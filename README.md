#Steps to start the server:
1) start terminal from the root folder of project and run:

      `npm install`
      
      (this will install all needed dependencies to "node_modules" folder)
      
2) Copy/paste .env.example file and rename it to .env (now You will have app variables in there)
      
3) After installation complete please run:

      `npm start`
      
      This will start a Node server which will be accessible on **http://127.0.0.1:8080**
      P.S. Variables are taken from .env file
